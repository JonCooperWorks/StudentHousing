		<h2>Overview</h2>
		<p>
			This website is a project developed in Flask, a python microframework, and hosted on the Google App Engine. 
			It was developed in response to the lack of a convenient rental listing for students in Jamaica, and as a way 
			of learning Flask. It is based on the Flask GAE Template, a Flask package pre-configured for use on the App Engine,
			created by <a href="https://github.com/kamalgill">Kamal Gill</a>. 
		</p>
		<h2>Code Snippets</h2>
		<h3>Jinja2 Form Macros</h3>
		<p>
			<script src="https://gist.github.com/3255031.js"> </script>
			The above macros are used to render both individual fields and entire forms generated by WTForms. 
			The render_form macro does not allow passing of arguments to individual fields, so if any customization is needed,
			it is more pragmatic to call render_field() for each field in the form individually.
		</p>
		<h3>Send Email using the App Engine Email API</h3>
		<p>
			<script src="https://gist.github.com/3255049.js"> </script>
			The function above takes the values given from a form generated by WTForms and sends an email from the
			signed in user's Google Account.  Any errors that occur during sending will be logged, and viewable in
			the GAE Dashboard Logs. The field names in the form model will need to match the values shown above, 
			or vice versa. To use this function for admin emails, simply pass the administrator email address to the function.
			<p><strong>Note:</strong> The Google App Engine email API only allows sending from an email address associated with a 
			user, or an email address of a registered admin.</p>
		</p>
		<h3>WTForms Custom Validators</h3>
		<p>
			<script src="https://gist.github.com/3255093.js"> </script>
			The above functions allow for validation of phone numbers and email headers through WTForms in order to prevent header
			injection and invalid phone numbers. Works for 10-digit phone numbers (555-555-5555) and 7-digit phone numbers (555-5555).
		</p>
		<h3>Jinja2 Custom Filters</h3>
		<p>
			The jinja2 filters below allow for insertion of HTML characters with the jinja2 <i>safe</i> filter, due to the
			@evalcontextfilter decorator marking them as eval-context dependent filters. This gives more flexibility to the
			template designer, as s/he can pass markup to the templates.
		</p>
		<p>
			<script src="https://gist.github.com/3255152.js"> </script>
			The filter above takes any 10 or 7-digit string and represents it in the form "(555)-555-5555" or "555-5555". This filter
			was meant to standardize phone number output in case of varying phone number styles, in order to enforce consistency in 
			phone number styles across the website. A similar filter could also be applied before the number is saved to the database to
			ensure uniformity of data in the data store.
		</p>
		<p>
			<script src="https://gist.github.com/3255178.js"> </script>
			The jinja2 filter above translates Boolean values into any strings of your choosing, the default being "Yes" and "No" for True and False 
			respectively.
